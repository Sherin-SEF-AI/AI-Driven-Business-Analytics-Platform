# AI-Driven-Business-Analytics-Platform


AI-Driven Business Analytics Platform
This project is a sophisticated platform built for data-driven business insights, forecasting, and customer segmentation. Powered by advanced machine learning algorithms, AI, and data visualization tools, it enables users to forecast sales, predict churn, segment customers, analyze trends, detect anomalies, and more. This platform uses Python libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, plotly, networkx, and Streamlit to create an interactive and powerful business dashboard.

Features
1. Sales Forecasting
Random Forest Regression: Provides future sales predictions based on historical data using machine learning.
Simple Moving Average: Offers a simpler method for short-term forecasting using a moving average.
2. Customer Churn Prediction
Uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn based on historical customer behavior.
Displays the accuracy of the churn prediction model along with feature importance for better insights.
3. Customer Segmentation
Implements K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation based on selected features.
The platform provides 3D visualizations and calculates the silhouette score for assessing clustering performance.
4. Network Graph Visualization
Allows users to create network graphs from relational data using networkx and plotly.
Visualizes complex relationships between entities with interactive graphs.
5. Automated Insights Generation
Automatically generates business insights based on trends and top categories in the data.
6. Interactive Visualizations
Users can create custom visualizations (scatter, line, bar, box plots, etc.) from the uploaded data.
A built-in data explorer allows for easy interaction with the dataset, with options for highlighting max values in the table.
7. Correlation Heatmap
Generates a correlation heatmap for numeric variables to identify relationships between different features.
8. Anomaly Detection
Detects outliers in the dataset based on Z-scores, helping to identify unusual behaviors or events.
9. Time Series Decomposition
Decomposes time series data into trend, seasonal, and residual components for deeper analysis.
10. Trend & Seasonality Analysis
Provides moving average-based trend analysis and seasonality detection (daily and monthly) for the chosen variables.
11. AI-Powered Business Insights
Integrates with Google Gemini API for natural language query processing, allowing users to ask business-related questions and get AI-powered responses.
